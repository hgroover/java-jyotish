Data format for symbolic representation

The achart Java applet can produce symbolic data representing the end product of calculations.
The format of this symbolic data is described in this document.

Goals
The following goals drive the design of the symbolic data format
* Context-free - the data must be useable either as a single unit or as part of a set of units
* Compact - the data must be reasonably compact
* Machine-readable - the data must be easily parsed
* Basic character set - the data must be represented using numbers and case-sensitive characters, avoiding use
  of symbols, especially those involved in URLs
* The data should be easy to use in constructing SQL queries and/or regular expressions

Unit definition
A unit is separated from other units by whitespace and defines a single point (ascendant, planet or node)
in one of the chart divisions. Thus to represent nine planets (sun, moon, five planets plus lunar nodes
Rahu and Ketu) plus ascendant in both Rasi and Navamsa charts requires 20 units.

Basic data types
Some basic data types recur frequently and are represented as follows:
<bool> : boolean value represented as 1 (true, yes, on) or 0 (false, no, off)
<zvalue> : zodiac value which can have values between 01 and 12 inclusive (e.g. sign, house).
  Leading 0 used to pad number
<pvalue> : lowercase planet symbol su mo ma me ve ju sa ra ke
<float> : floating point value
<pname> : planet or point name - two-letter lowercase values as, su, mo, me, ma, ve, ea, ra, ke, sa, ju, ne, ur, pl
<division> : chart division - 2-digit numeric representation of division, e.g. 01 for rasi chart, 03 for drekkana,
  04 for caturthamsa, 12 for dvadasamsa, etc.
<nvalue> : naksatra value which can range from 01 to 27
<mvalue> : fixed (0), movable (1) or dual (2)
<acount> : aspect count 01 - 12
<avalue> : <pvalue> <astrength> <acount>
<pnumber> : point number 01 = sun, 02 = moon, 03 = lagna, 04 = mercury, 05 = venus, 06 = mars, 07 = jupiter, 08 = saturn, 09 = rahu, 10 = ketu
<qvalue> : naksatra pada value (quarter) from 1-4

Unique data pairs can occur exactly once, whereas repeat data pairs may occur more than once
<udatapair> : <uid> <value>
<rdatapair> : <id> <value>
<value> : <nvalue> | <division> | <float> | <zvalue> | <bool> | <avalue> | <pnumber> | <qvalue>
<uid>: 'P' | 'N' | 'H' | 'S' | 'M' | 'Q' | 'T' | 'K' | 'X' | 'U'
<rid>: 'L' | 'A' | 'C' | 'R'

'T' = tithi, 01 - 15
'K' = paksa, 1 (gaura/sukla), 2 (krishna)
'X' = is malefic (moon is malefic from krishnastami through gaurastami)
'C' = planet conjunct with
'R' = receiving aspect from - same format as A without 2 digits indicating separation
'U' = combust (0 or not present = not at all; 1 = combust; 2 = deep combust)
'O' = ownership / occupation
	'-2' House of bitter enemy
	'-1' House of enemy
	'0'	Neutral
	'1' House of friend
	'2' House of great friend
	'3' Own sign
'E' = exaltation / debilitation / MTK values:
	'-2' Extreme debilitation
	'-1' Debilitated
	'1' Exalted
	'2' Highly exalted
	'3' mUla-trikoNa
'Z' = longitude in decimal degrees (float)
'B' = 1 if retrograde, 2 if stopped

'D' is not set but reserved for derived values. By convention some of the derived values are:
  Dcx<value>	Has conjunction with {malefic, benefic}
  Drx<value>	Receives aspect of {malefic, benefic}

Unit syntax
<pname> '-' <division> ':'

Aspects need to be represented either this way or via <avalue>
<pname> <astrength> <pname> '-' <division>

<astrength> : '[' <qvalue> ']'
qvalues represent the number of quarters of fullness, i.e. 4 is 100%, 3 is 75%, 2 is 50%, 1 is 25%
<qvalue> : '1' | '2' | '3' | '4'
